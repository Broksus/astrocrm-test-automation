/**
 * 1. **Locator Reliability**:
 *    - Since not all elements have unique test IDs, I created locators
 *      based on the available attributes. However, this approach might not
 *      always be reliable.
 *    - **Recommendation**: To improve locator reliability, I would add
 *      unique test IDs or ensure that existing ones can be reliably
 *      distinguished.
 * 
 * 2. **Optimization for Test Speed**:
 *    - To reduce test execution time, I recommend operating with an expert
 *      who is already logged in, created through the API.
 *    - In the test, I would focus on verifying the business logic and functionality.
 * 
 * 3. **Parallel Context Testing**:
 *    - The next test would involve a parallel context window, simulating a
 *      registered client who starts a conversation with the expert.
 *    - The client should be created via the API and be preloaded with a balance.
 *    - The expert should then be able to accept the conversation and apply the
 *      relevant test script.
